<br /><br />
A simple React component, written using Typescript that allows users to scrub through product images by hovering their mouse.

- Can take a large amount of images, although recommend no more than 16
- Set `showHoverGrid` as `true` to show red image hover areas / edit mode
- Can adjust `width` &amp; `height`, otherwise default will expand to fix `100%` of parent container
- Hide product name &amp; id with `hideName` &amp; `hideId`
- Pass child components to overlay your own custom UI `<ProductScrubber> {...} </ProductScrubber>`
